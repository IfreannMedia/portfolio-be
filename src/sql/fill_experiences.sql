	'Working at adesso I took care of multiple full stack web applications for a large client in the automotive sector. Aside from feature development, my tasks included migrating two Angular frontends to the latest major version, at the time 13.x.x, and then integrating the smaller of the frontends into the larger one. I also worked extensively across the entire tech stack, from frontend to backend to CI/CD and OPS. Business communications were primarily carried out in German, and I had the pleasure of working with excellent colleagues.',

	'During my time at Akka I worked on two large scale web applications for a client in the automotive industry. My first role was as a frontend dev, working on a cross platform SPA targeting iPhones, Chrome, and Android, built with Ionic, Angular, and Typescript. It was deployed in many countries in multiple languages. As well as planning and developing new feature suites, I had the honour of migrating the frontend from Angular 5 to Angular 11. Soon after I began work as a full stack developer on a large scale web portal for materials and tools management built with Liferay (Java, Oracle DB, Typescript, Javascript, Html, JSP). Business communications were primarily carried out in German, I got to work with some excellent colleagues too.',
